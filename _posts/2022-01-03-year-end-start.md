Well, I thought 2021 just swept through like our very own [Minnal Murali](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7268738/) or like the __Flash__.

## But the reality is,
I had a lot of fun in 2021. Almost as if a huge debt of void from 2020 has been cleared. But in the last two weeks of December, I started worrying too much about the future and completely forgot my beautiful moments. Thanks to my old friend, I happened to narrate my experiences last year and be grateful for it.

Personally and professionally, I undersell myself. Thankfully, it changed this year. My self-confidence went up in personal aspects. All thanks to the people I've met. Perhaps, it is in the European culture maybe.

## What the future holds
Thinking about the future isn't that bad after all. I have decided to prioritize learning over fun as that debt has been cleared and I have completed my 1st semester ;). I'm still not sure what I want in life. (Haha, not a great thing to share with the Job Market). And I carry the impostor syndrome despite the amazing feedback I got from all my collaborations. 

Anyway, I spoke to few of my ex-colleagues to get a perspective and prioritize my time. Some believe it's AI for HealthCare (_I think so too_), some think it's MLOps but one person thinks it doesn't matter as long as you as keep learning. Well, that's too broad a statement to make but I got the gist.

I will be shuffling between the below topics for this year...

* NLP (Computational Linguistics) -> Most of my time -> Syntax, Morphology, Multilingualism, etc.
* Software Engineering -> FastAPI, Revisiting Dockers, Git.
* System Design -> O'Reilly Book on System Design - If possible
* MLOps -> Andrew's NG course on MLOps
* Practical stuff -> Edge Deployment - Over phone, browser.
* Tech Blogging, Weekend Hiking.
* Cloud -> Check any free Azure/AWS courses and complete them
* Learning Spanish and Dutch
* Complete atleast 5 telugu novels -> _Kanyasulkam_, _Asamarthuni jeevana yatra_ & more
* Other books -> "Guns, Germs and Steel" & "The Bonobo and the Atheist" & "The Selfish Gene" & "The Rational Optimist".
* I am also inclined towards becoming a consultant. Will keep a track of it.
* Motto of 2022 -> "If you don't ask, the answer is __always__ NO."
