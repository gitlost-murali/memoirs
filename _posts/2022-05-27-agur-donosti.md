# About

With an almost heavy heart, I write this article to say goodbye to my dear ones in Donosti. And ofcourse to the dearest Donosti as a city.

## 

Whatever the EU folks might have experienced/felt, I can promise that my learning curve is much bigger than others.

For analogy, let's assume that we're all 6-year-olds. Remember the time when we've passionately played football so-much-so that we were greasy & bruised. We were given a good bath, followed by combing the hair and applying _Yardley's_ on the cute butter-like cheeks, home to the most-innocent smiles.

I'm the same greasy-bruisy kid who came to Donosti and the city did its magic on me.

## To HAP/LAP students

While I could continue on how Donosti changed me, I can't risk sounding Narcisstic. And I want to share what I feel about you guys. I will go in the order of people I interacted more/ I like more.

### Nils

Nils -> So, Nils & my other LCT folks (Julia, Jelena, Anar & Ruan), we came as a group. For some reason, this thing alone, makes me feel closer to them. Anyway, on my very first day, I met Julia and Nils in Gros. Later, we went to see his flat and were discussing how to find a flat. Me being a c ore pessimist in the beginning started complaining how tough it is to find a room without speaking Spanish. Julia, being the most empathetic person, immediately turned to Nils and said _"Maybe, we should go with him for house-hounting.?"_. To my surprise (SHOCK), Nils had a stonecold expression, almost inherently saying _"That's not my problem"_. So, my first impression lived up to the stereotypes of Germans.

I re-asserted myself saying "You're an adult now. You don't need assistance in all aspects of life.". Even while facing racist comments, I didn't turn to any of them for help. But one day, because of a really racist action (not just comment), I had a breakdown originating from helpless anger on how can my skin color or country decide my character. At that point, I just knew two people in the city. I wanted to share it with someone. Definitely not with stone-hearted Nils (haha), plus his girlfriend is in town.

Anyway, a month later, I locked myself out of the room. I had no option but to take help from Nils. Lot of instances like these.

On Dec 18th, I agreed for a hike with him in Orio but the night before that, I was robbed. I couldn't convey him that I was robbed and cannot come to the hike. Obviously, he was pissed and did the hike alone. He offered me some cash since I'm robbed. I declined but I really liked that he kept nudging me to take it. It might seem a normal thing to do, trust me I have seen folks who just kept a straight face and said "ok". So, that act of kindness and help from Nils, moved me. There's that.


A month later, we were drinking on a Thursday (I mean all Thursdays) but this time just the both of us.

The pizza potes organized by Nils reminded me of a family member nudging everyone to join for dinner. It just felt good to see LCT folks together.
