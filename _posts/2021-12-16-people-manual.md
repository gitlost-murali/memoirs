# People's Manual

## About 

{% include note.html content="A memoir is a non-fictional, first personal written account of events and memories from the author's real life. At times, letting readers learn something from it.
" %}

This post serves two purposes:
1. Introducing self: Establishing priorities & opinions
2. Suggesting things which I wouldn't do otherwise

## My quirks

* I’m an ambivert. I can party hard and enjoy my solitude as well.
* My silence and lack of small talk may discomfort you. Please excuse me.
* With all modesty, I don't get angry.

## What I like / dislike

* You can always reach out and suggest/comment on me. I will be open-minded. I learn fast.
* I disrespect arrogance. I’ll respect you as a human being and ignore you.

## Communicating with me

* Use few words – whether written or spoken. _Don’t ramble_. I pick up fast. I’ll ask if I don’t understand.
* I like conversations. We can talk about something trivial to non-trivial. But definitely not badmouthing people. More in the later sections.
* Specifically, I always welcome technical interaction. I may be busy, but please reach out to me. I appreciate it.
* I’m a late morning person. Many others are early morning people. So I’m generally free after 10:30am.
* I’m very open to new ideas. If I resist, try again after a day or two. **I have strong opinions held weakly** (i.e. I change them quickly when convinced otherwise.)

## Alcohol

Alcohol is an uninvited and unplanned guest in my life. Since it has been only an year that I started, here are a few things I understood about my relationship with it:

1. If I'm uncomfortable around the people I'm drinking with, I binge drink to ease myself.

2. If I'm comfortable, I would enjoy my time having conversation with you. I would prefer **you** over alcohol.

3. Surprisingly, I met a few people who drink to do things under the disguise of being drunk. Unfortunately, I can detect this bullshit easily. Accept yourself and your wants/needs. Try talking to me when sober. I'm great at pulling off these kind of conversations. Please don't repeat _you're drunk_ just after the first drink and every drink that follows.

## Badmouthing
{% include tip.html content="Dissociating the political aspects of it, the word bitching usually refers to badmouthing." %}

This aspect alone talks alot about your insecurities and makes a huge difference in our friendship. I regret every second of mine hearing your futile opinion/rant about a 3rd person who's not in the spot. It will pull you down in others' eyes. I would prefer solitude over spending time with you. 

Quoting Sirivennela Sastry garu, 
>"శత్రువులు నీకున్న లోపాలే, స్నేహితులు నీకున్న ఇష్టాలే"

This roughly translates to 

"All your friends reflect your interests. All your enemies reflect your drawbacks."

### Specifics: The Nuances
I have my drawbacks as well. Infact, a person without drawbacks is an enigma to me. What matters is, _"what **kind of** drawbacks?"_. If you are angry with almost everyone around you, you've made a living hell around yourself. If the presence of a person is making you angry, you've handed over the authority to that person.

### Specifics: The Nuances: 3rd Person?
If you're bitching about a political figure or even a professor's inefficiency, I am okay with it. I'm not comfortable badmouthing our peers. Outright, NO.

It might seem tough but there are a lot of other things we can talk about. Many trivial things too. Ok, I end this with a caustic sentence : __"How pathetic should you be to remember your enemies and feel much worse."__

## Willing to accept

I prefer you being completely honest with me. For example, If you think my attire/words don't think are appropriate, think of it as a suggestion and let me know. If you don't tell, I would never know and never change.

## Finally,

It is only after meeting some wonderful people, my pessimistic attitude on life changed. I cannot risk going back. This post is a selfish attempt to save my positive perspective.

Thanks to my Masters, I'm living in the most beautiful city, thronged with young folks. It feels great to meet a lot of youngsters. While I enjoy the company of my prospective friends, I felt that it can be better. Hence, the post.
