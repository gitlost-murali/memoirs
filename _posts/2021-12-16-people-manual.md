# People's Manual

## About 

{% include note.html content="A memoir is a non-fictional, first personal written account of events and memories from the author's real life. At times, letting readers learn something from it.
" %}

This post serves two purposes:
1. Introducing self: Establishing priorities & opinions
2. Suggesting things which I wouldn't do otherwise

## My quirks

* I’m an ambivert. I can party hard and also enjoy my solitude as well.
* My silence and lack of small talk may discomfort you. Please excuse me.
* With all modesty, I don't get angry.

## What I like / dislike

* You can always reach out and suggest/comment on me. I will be open-minded. I learn fast.
* I disrespect arrogance. I’ll respect you as a human being and ignore you.

## Communicating with me

* Use few words – whether written or spoken. _Don’t ramble_. I pick up fast. I’ll ask if I don’t understand.
* I like conversations. We can talk about something trivial to non-trivial. But definitely not badmouthing people. More in the later sections.
* Specifically, I always welcome technical interaction. I may be busy, but please reach out to me. I appreciate it.
* I’m a late morning person. Many others are early morning people. So I’m generally free after 11:00am.
* I’m very open to new ideas. If I resist, try again after a day or two. **I have strong opinions held weakly** (i.e. I change them quickly when convinced otherwise.)

## Social Conversations

* In gatherings of 3+ people, I tend to be quiet since it's difficult to find a common topic and if there's some success, that's going to be the most trivial & boring thing.

## Badmouthing

Quoting Sirivennela Sastry garu, 
>"శత్రువులు నీకున్న లోపాలే, స్నేహితులు నీకున్న ఇష్టాలే"

This roughly translates to 

_"All your friends reflect your interests. All your enemies reflect your drawbacks."_

* I neither encourage nor enjoy discussing bad aspects of a 3rd person.

## Alcohol

Alcohol is an uninvited and unplanned guest in my life. Since it has been only an year that I started, here are a few things I understood about my relationship with it:

1. If I'm uncomfortable around the people I'm drinking with, I binge drink to ease myself.

2. If I'm comfortable, I would enjoy my time having conversation with you. I would prefer **you** over alcohol.

## Willing to accept

I prefer you being completely honest with me. For example, If you think my attire/words don't think are appropriate, think of it as a suggestion and let me know. If you don't tell, I would never know and never change.

## Finally,

It is only after meeting some wonderful people, my pessimistic attitude on life changed. I cannot risk going back. This post is a selfish attempt to save my positive perspective.

Thanks to my Masters, I'm living in the most beautiful city, thronged with young folks. It feels great to meet a lot of youngsters. While I enjoy the company of my prospective friends, I felt that it can be better. Hence, the post.
