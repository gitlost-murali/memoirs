# About

Ideally, I wanted to use this platform for writing a farewell message to everyone but this post came first. 

This is specifically for HAP/LAP students. Apologies for the rudeness that may appear merely or abundantly. The current month, May, is beyond doubt overwhelming for all of us. Besides the submissions, I need to cope up with my 2nd year university coordinator's lazyness/apathy and complete my registration, visa process in __record time__. In between all this, I started lifting, thereby limiting the carbs intake. For those unaware, limited carbs -> limited patience. So, things are going to get a lot crazier from my side. This post is a helpless attempt to ask forgiveness for my future behaviour.

## The last minute stuff

I'm an anxious guy. I try to avoid it by working early or on time. Unless you're Julia/Jelena/Nils, I don't believe in your capabilities to solve things over a weekend. **Or** I have under-estimated you or I might not have worked with you before to assess.

## For Hoder's sake, RESPOND

If you have work, I understand. Absolutely no problem if you cannot work too. But, **Please** respond in the group. I'm not asking you out on a dinner date. Just like my last sentence, I may nudge you to respond on a meeting date/time.

Career advice from my limited 2 years of work experience: Regardless of how talented you are, if you are too shy to even respond, the path is going to be tough.
