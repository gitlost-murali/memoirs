# About

Ideally, I wanted to use this platform for writing a farewell message to everyone but this post came first. 

This is specifically for HAP/LAP students. Apologies for the rudeness that may appear merely or abundantly. The current month, May, is beyond doubt overwhelming for all of us. Besides the submissions, I need to cope up with my 2nd year university coordinator's lazyness/apathy and complete my registration, visa process in __record time__. In between all this, I started lifting, thereby limiting the carbs intake. For those unaware, limited carbs -> limited patience. So, things are going to get a lot crazier from my side. This post is a helpless attempt to ask forgiveness for my future behaviour.

## The last minute stuff

<!-- I don't believe in your capabilities to solve things over a weekend -->
I'm an anxious guy. I try to avoid it by working early or on time. Unless you're Julia/Jelena/Nils, I'm not comfortable believing that we can solve things over a weekend. **Or** I have under-estimated you **or** I might not have worked with you before to assess.

Don't take my previous statement to heart. It is not made w.r.t just one aspect but multiple aspects of a project like coding/latex/writing/thinking, etc.

## The deciding factor

The only decided factor is what works best for the project.

## For Hoder's sake, RESPOND

If you have work, I understand. Absolutely no problem if you cannot work too. But, **Please** respond in the group. Replying after 3-4 days is futile. I'm not asking you out on a dinner date to feel bad when you say No. Just like my last sentence, I may get pushy to make you respond to a meeting date/time.

I think this helps you in your work life too. Regardless of how talented you are, if you are too shy to even respond, the path is going to be tough in Industry.


That's it. That's all my madness.
