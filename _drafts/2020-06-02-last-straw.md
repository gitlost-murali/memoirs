# The Last Straw

It is a usual practice to quit job only when the VISA is confirmed but I decided to do that early. This article is more on that final action that galvanized me to quit early.

## Events building up

For any organization to be successful, it is the people that matter. The company's problem is exactly that - Hiring!. Often times, I find folks who are absolutely incompetent and irrelevant to the role offered. Result is visible in the high attrition rate.

The overall talent allocation process is flawed. For ex, If a Vice President of Analytics is made Lead Data Scientist for a project, his/her decisions for the project are going to be broken. For instance, the hardware requirements filed by the Lead were 8 512 GB GPUs (Really?) and 1-day estimate for data annotation and a month's time to complete whole project. There was no project solution on paper. And two 1-hour catch up calls every day to track progress. End result is that he left trying to catch up the knitty-gritties of data science which, in outer market, are not a part of his/her job.

As this continued, in a span of 8 months, in a team of 3 members, 4 members left. Out of these 4 members, 3 left due to incompetence. This speaks volumes about the __skill__ of Head of Talent Acquisition and Senior Analytics President.

## The Last Straw

My Work-Manager, let's call him `Race Horse`, is the most apathetic and work-driven human being. I wrote a mail to the team saying that I have COVID symptoms to which `Race Horse` cc's everyone and asks me what is the status of the task I'm working on and when can it be done.

This definitely is a starting point. Later, I replied to the mail with details. As time progresses, I am taking rest as my oxygen level symptoms are dropping.
