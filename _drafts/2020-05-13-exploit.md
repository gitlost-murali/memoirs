# Exploiting Young India

{% include note.html content="Limited to companies under observation" %}


"In every crisis lies an opportunity" - Companies did take it seriously and benefitted hugely from the vulnerability of the employees. Out of all the exploitations, I would like to point towards a few scenarios:


1. Case-1: Rating of 4.9 will be rounded-off to 4 __(not 5)__.
2. Case-2: Rating of 4.8 will be __manually over-rided__ to 4.5 and then __rounded-off__ to 4.

India is abound young folks.
