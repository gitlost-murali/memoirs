# Why this article?

* Some european friends were interested in knowing Indian music. 
* Some wanted my opinion on Rajesh Kuthrapally's depiction of Indians.
* Some saw Slum-dog millionare and assumed that is all India is.

I'm not a patriot in any manner. The sole objective of this article to let you see India from my perspective. 

Let me try explaining this to you. The term `we` will be used to represent the collective India/just-me. 

## Music

Until recently (2019ish), we don't have a music band culture. Subsequently, we don't know the distinction between pop, hip-hop, rock, etc. That doesn't mean we are alien to these genres. We hear them, disguised under the name of movie songs. 

Ok, __movie songs__. An interesting fact for you. Almost all Indian movies have 6 musicals in them. How strange, right? But that's how we grew up.
