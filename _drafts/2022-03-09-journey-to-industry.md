## About 

{% include note.html content="A memoir is a non-fictional, first personal written account of events and memories from the author's real life. At times, letting readers learn something from it.
" %}

This post is addressed to folks who are done with their academics and looking to hop on to a new job. Think of it as a friend telling you what lies ahead. I hope you find atleast one of it useful.

## Startup / Not

Young folks like chaos, flat heirarchy and flexibility. And most mediocre startups are (in)famous in using these baits (in addition to keywords like "exposure") to lure you.

I'm not saying all startups are bad or that you should never join a startup. As a beginner, I suggest you to not do it.

I strongly recommend you to read [this blog](https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html) by Chip Huyen. Like right now!!

## Know the rules of Job Market

Job Market - In stock market, people bet on stocks. Here, people bet on you.

### The 2-year rule

If you're financially appreciated __and__ promoted in 2 years, it means you are important to your employer. Otherwise, it means one of the two things - 1. You're not working enough 2. You're not appreciated enough.

So, regardless of the silly internal employer awards, __always__ assess your value in the job market. This gives you the power in negotiation and an estimate of salary you deserve.

> Put your papers down -> Notice of Resignation

### Start high

Your prospective employer will be willing to give you 30-50% more than your current salary.

Let's say, you made the mistake of earning 40k Euros per year and you realized that the average salary of a data scientist is around 70-80k. When you discuss with your employer, following things can happen:

1. Best case: They apologize for underpaying you but since financial matters are addressed only at the end of the year, you'd have to wait for an year.
2. Worst case: You'll look like a fool for asking a 100% pay hike. Honestly, no employer would do it. The max they could offer is 20-30% depending on the company. 

### Pitching an estimate

Recruiting officers' objective is to obtain best talent with minimal cost. So, they almost always ask you to provide an estimate (first). This gives them an edge in three ways.

1. If you quote less, they're on the winning side.
2. If you quote the exact amount, they'll bargain to bring it down by 20-25%.
3. If you quote too high, there will be an amount of shock and they end up saying the upper limit they can offer.

So, you must quote a (much) higher amount than the one you want.

Remember that: At the end of day, it is business.
MEME - This is business.

### Look at their working style

Sprints: Team members meet to 
1. Identify the status of current tasks
2. Distributing tasks among the group
3. Demos, etc.

Common practice is 2-weeks.

And then there will be daily standups. I believe in productivity bursts. There can be times where you are not productive. To me, this looks like a scrutiny everyday.

Find out the frequency of status checks. I've seen 2-6 status-check meetings per day. That's literally 1 meeting every 1.5 hours. Always ask them the frequency of status checks. 

### Look at their tech stack

Slack, Microsoft Teams check your mouse and keyboard movements to decide your working status (Online/Offline). There's a rumour that your managers can plot your active working hours. I feel it as invasion of privacy.

Slack is okay but not Microsoft Teams. 

### Interact with fellow workers

1. Ask if they're happy with the current hike cycle.
2. Ask how do they spend their weekends.
