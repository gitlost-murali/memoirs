At times, letting readers learn something from it. This memoir reflects how an uncertain, unexpected calamity affected me in career and mental aspects. . Lockdown, Travel and Masters . It has been an year since I got my EMLCT Masters Admit with a full-ride scholarship. Due to COVID-19, there was a blanket ban on international travel for the most part.
